# Godot Visualization Tools

/!\ Rewrite in progress with Godot 3.5. Documentation coming soon.

A collection of scripts and tools for debug visualizations of collision shapes.

This is a work-in-progress. Mose of this code comes from our project [Godot Node Essentials](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-node-essentials).
